# Installing

Installing `ethereal-react` can be done with any npm-compatible package manager, such as `yarn`, `npm`. We recommend [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), as it provides a great user experience, and is incredibly fast.

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm' },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm add ethereal-react
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add ethereal-react
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm add ethereal-react
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**ETHERS**

TODO: Your project may need `ethers` installed if it does not already.

## Importing the package

The `ethereal-react` package exports modern ES modules, in addition to legacy formats.
Using ES modules is preferred, as it allows for the package to be effectly tree-shaken, which can result in smaller bundles being delivered to end-users.
For example, using the named exports from the package with ESM works as follows:

```tsx
import { Provider } from "ethereal-react";
```

If your project uses CommonJS, then you can use `require` with `ethereal-react` as well:

```tsx
const { Provider } = require("react");
```
