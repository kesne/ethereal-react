# Introduction

A collection of React hooks and components, making it easy to develop frontends for Ethereum dApps.

## Features

- Powered by the popular [ethers](https://ethers.org/) package, which handles all ethereum functionality.
- Leverages modern React features, such as Suspense, Error Boundaries, and concurrent rendering.
- Built-in support for connecting to wallets using [Web3Modal](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal).
- Full support for TypeScript out of the box, including fully-typed contracts with [TypeChain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain).
- Small bundle size, and tree-shakable module. Currently ~2.5 kB gzipped for all features.

## Requirements

- React 17+, works best in React versions that support concurrent rendering (18+).
